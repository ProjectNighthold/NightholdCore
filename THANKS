= NightholdCore -- Thanks/credits file =

NightholdCore is a derivation/rewrite of Trinity, which was originally written
by Team Python and the WoW Daemon Team. Many people further helped Trinity Core
by submitting bug reports, code patches, and suggestions.

Thanks to the community!

Thanks too for other projects that give us inspiration and code that we
can adapt for our project and fixes that help us reach our goal of making
the best Legion Emulator.

If You see a script or code that is yours and dont have proper mentioning on this thanks file,
contact us to rectify, this core passed down in many hands for so much time that a lot of
credits and thanks are not mentioned on it.

And finally thanks to Thordekk, without him selling me the code and showing me his lack of guilt
for stealing code from others, probably i wouldnt knew that he asked help to a lot of other open
source devs to fix things and share scripts and didnt give them credit or part of the money he
get from their code.

Special thanks should go out to the NightholdCore team, Keep up the good work guys.
